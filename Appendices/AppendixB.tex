\textbf{Titel}\\
Repository Detective: Compute productivity metrics from git repositories

\textbf{Beschreibung}\\
Git repositories contain a lot of data: source code, commits, time stamps of these commits, issues, pull requests, comments etc. Analyzing this data can provide valuable metrics for software developers, for example:

\begin{itemize}
    \item which parts of the code are frequently being edited
    \item what percentage of contributions from developer X made it into the main branch
    \item what is the time (min/avg/max) between creating a pull request and merging it?
\end{itemize}

In a current MSE project, we are building a platform for mining raw data from a repository, analyzing the data, and visualizing key performance metrics.

In this project, you will
\begin{itemize}
    \item search the literature for existing performance metrics for software repositories
    \item get familiar with the existing platform and how it can be extended   \item design analysis algorithms for additional performance metrics
    \item implement these algorithms by extending the platform with tools that compute and visualize a set of performance metrics
\end{itemize}

Technologies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item C\# (backend)
    \item React (frontend)
\end{itemize}
Voraussetzungen
\begin{itemize}
    \item strong interest in software engineering
    \item intrinsic motivation for the topic
    \item good communication skills
    \item ability to work in an agile setting where the path to the solution changes along the way
\end{itemize}
