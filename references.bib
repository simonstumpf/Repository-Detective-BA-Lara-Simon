	abstract = {Objectives: The aim of this study is to provide an empirical understanding of the bad practices followed in the code review process, that are code review (CR) smells.
Methods: We first conduct a multivocal literature review in order to gather code review bad practices discussed in white and gray literature. Then, we conduct a targeted survey with 32 experienced software practitioners and perform follow-up interviews in order to get their expert opinion. Based on this process, a taxonomy of code review smells is introduced. To quantitatively demonstrate the existence of these smells, we analyze 226,292 code reviews collected from eight OSS projects.
Results: We observe that a considerable number of code review smells exist in all projects with varying degrees of ratios. The empirical results illustrate that 72.2\% of the code reviews among eight projects are affected by at least one code review smell.
Conclusion: The empirical analysis shows that the OSS projects are substantially affected by the code review smells. The provided taxonomy could provide a foundation for best practices and tool support to detect and avoid code review smells in practice.},

	abstract = {DevOps integrates collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement, enhancing agility, reducing time to market, and ensuring consistent software releases. A key component of this process is GitLab's Merge Request (MR) mechanism, which streamlines code submission and review. Studies have extensively analyzed MR data and similar mechanisms like GitHub pull requests and Gerrit Code Review, focusing on metrics such as review completion time and time to first comment. However, MR data also reflects broader aspects, including collaboration patterns, productivity, and process optimization. This study examines 26.7k MRs from four teams across 116 projects of a networking software company to analyze DevOps processes. We first assess the impact of external factors like COVID-19 and internal changes such as migration to OpenShift. Findings show increased effort and longer MR review times during the pandemic, with stable productivity and a lasting shift to out-of-hours work, reaching 70\% of weekly activities. The transition to OpenShift was successful, with stabilized metrics over time. Additionally, we identify prioritization patterns in branch management, particularly in stable branches for new releases, underscoring the importance of workflow efficiency. In code review, while bots accelerate review initiation, human reviewers remain crucial in reducing review completion time. Other factors, such as commit count and reviewer experience, also influence review efficiency. This research provides actionable insights for practitioners, demonstrating how MR data can enhance productivity, effort analysis, and overall efficiency in DevOps.},

	abstract = {Code review is a potential means of improving software quality. To be effective, it depends on different factors, and many have been investigated in the literature to identify the scenarios in which it adds quality to the final code. However, factors associated with distributed software development, which is becoming increasingly common, have been little explored. Geographic distance can impose additional challenges to the reviewing process. We thus in this paper present the results of a mixed-method study of the effectiveness of code review in distributed software development. We investigate factors that can potentially influence the outcomes of peer code review. The study involved an analysis of objective data collected from a software project involving 201 members and a survey with 50 practitioners with experience in code review. Our analysis of objective data led to the conclusion that a high number of changed lines of code tends to increase the review duration with a reduced number of messages, while the number of involved teams, locations, and participant reviewers generally improve reviewer contributions, but with a severe penalty to the duration. These results are consistent with those obtained in the survey regarding the influence of factors over duration and participation. However, participants’ opinion about the impact on contributions diverges from results obtained from historical data, mainly with respect to distribution.},

To inform future approaches for automatic stress and overload detection, this paper establishes empirically collected measures of the work patterns of software engineers. To this aim, we perform the first large-scale study of software engineers' working hours by investigating the time stamps of commit activities of 86 large open source software projects, both containing hired and volunteer developers. We find that two thirds of software engineers mainly follow typical office hours, empirically established to be from 10h to 18h, and do not usually work during nights and weekends. Large variations between projects and individuals exist. Surprisingly, we found no support that project maturation would decrease abnormal working hours. In the Firefox case study, we found that hired developers work more during office hours while seniority, either in terms of number of commits or job status, did not impact working hours. We conclude that the use of working hours or timestamps of work products for stress detection requires establishing baselines at the level of individuals.},

	abstract = {Critical open-source projects form the basis of many large software systems. They provide trusted and extensible implementations of important functionality for cryptography, compatibility, and security. Verifying commit authorship authenticity in open-source projects is essential and challenging. Git users can freely configure author details such as names and email addresses. Platforms like GitHub use such information to generate profile links to user accounts. We demonstrate three attack scenarios malicious actors can use to manipulate projects and profiles on GitHub to appear trustworthy. We designed a mixed-research study to assess the effect on critical open-source software projects and evaluated countermeasures. First, we conducted a largescale measurement among 50,328 critical open-source projects on GitHub and demonstrated that contribution workflows can be abused in 85.9\% of the projects. We identified 573,043 email addresses that a malicious actor can claim to hijack historic contributions and improve the trustworthiness of their accounts. When looking at commit signing as a countermeasure, we found that the majority of users (95.4\%) never signed a commit, and for the majority of projects (72.1\%), no commit was ever signed. In contrast, only 2.0\% of the users signed all their commits, and for 0.2\% of the projects all commits were signed. Commit signing is not associated with projects’ programming languages, topics, or other security measures. Second, we analyzed online security advice to explore the awareness of contributor spoofing and identify recommended countermeasures. Most documents exhibit awareness of the simple spoofing technique via Git commits but no awareness of problems with GitHub’s handling of email addresses.},

Understanding and anticipating the effects of adopting such kind of technology is important for planning and management. Our research is the first to investigate how developers use Actions and how several activity indicators change after their adoption. Our results indicate that, although only a small subset of repositories adopted GitHub Actions to date, there is a positive perception of the technology. Our findings also indicate that the adoption of GitHub Actions increases the number of monthly rejected pull requests and decreases the monthly number of commits on merged pull requests. These results are especially relevant for practitioners to understand and prevent undesirable effects on their projects.},

Contributors may modify their code, which causes several iterations of code review process, and makes code reviews time-consuming for both contributors and reviewers. In this article, we set out to study pull request modifications in a code review process. We collect nine projects on GitHub with 104 307 pull requests, and investigate pull request modifications through analyzing added commits after pull requests’ submission. By studying four research questions, we conclude our major findings as follow. First, 34.56\% of collected pull requests have modifications. Pull requests with modifications have longer lifetime but higher pass rates. Second, we conclude eight modification types indicating why pull requests are modified. Third, we propose a novel method called MClassify to automatically classify pull request modifications, which achieves the accuracy of 0.807. Fourth, various modification types affect code review differently from the perspective of lifetime and pass rate. Pull requests with source control system management modifications have the longest lifetime. These findings enable developers and researchers to understand a pull-based code review process better and make improvements.},

	abstract = {Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice that leads developers to integrate their work more frequently. Software projects have broadly adopted CI to ship new releases more frequently and to improve code integration. The adoption of CI is motivated by the allure of delivering new functionalities more quickly. However, there is little empirical evidence to support such a claim. Through the analysis of 162,653 pull requests (PRs) of 87 GitHub projects that are implemented in 5 different programming languages, we empirically investigate the impact of adopting CI on the time to deliver merged PRs. Surprisingly, only 51.3\% of the projects deliver merged PRs more quickly after adopting CI. We also observe that the large increase of PR submissions after CI is a key reason as to why projects deliver PRs more slowly after adopting CI. To investigate the factors that are related to the time-to-delivery of merged PRs, we train regression models that obtain sound median R-squares of 0.64-0.67. Finally, a deeper analysis of our models indicates that, before the adoption of CI, the integration-load of the development team, i.e., the number of submitted PRs competing for being merged, is the most impactful metric on the time to deliver merged PRs before CI. Our models also reveal that PRs that are merged more recently in a release cycle experience a slower delivery time.},

The results provide developer insights into how they define review quality, what factors contribute to how they evaluate submitted code, and what challenges they face when performing review tasks. We found that the review quality is primarily associated with the thoroughness of the feedback, the reviewer's familiarity with the code, and the perceived quality of the code itself. Also, we found that while different factors are perceived to contribute to the review quality, reviewers often find it difficult to keep their technical skills up-to-date, manage personal priorities, and mitigate context switching.},

	abstract = {Open source software is commonly portrayed as a meritocracy, where decisions are based solely on their technical merit. However, literature on open source suggests a complex social structure underlying the meritocracy. Social work environments such as GitHub make the relationships between users and between users and work artifacts transparent. This transparency enables developers to better use information such as technical value and social connections when making work decisions. We present a study on open source software contribution in GitHub that focuses on the task of evaluating pull requests, which are one of the primary methods for contributing code in GitHub. We analyzed the association of various technical and social measures with the likelihood of contribution acceptance. We found that project managers made use of information signaling both good technical contribution practices for a pull request and the strength of the social connection between the submitter and project manager when evaluating pull requests. Pull requests with many comments were much less likely to be accepted, moderated by the submitter's prior interaction in the project. Well-established projects were more conservative in accepting pull requests. These findings provide evidence that developers use both technical and social information when evaluating potential contributions to open source software projects.},

	abstract = {GitHub is a widely used collaborative platform for global software development. A pull request plays an important role in bridging code changes with version controlling. Developers can freely and parallelly submit pull requests to base branches and wait for the merge of their contributions. However, several developers may submit pull requests to edit the same lines of code; such pull requests result in a latent collaborative conflict. We refer such pull requests that tend to change the same lines and remain open during an overlapping time period to as competing pull requests. In this paper, we conduct a study on 9,476 competing pull requests from 60 Java repositories in GitHub. The data are collected by mining pull requests that are submitted in 2017 from top Java projects with the most forks. We explore how multiple pull requests change the same code via answering four research questions, including the distribution of competing pull requests, the involved developers, the changed lines of code, and the impact on pull request integration. Our study shows that there indeed exist competing pull requests in GitHub: in 45 out of 60 repositories, over 31\% of pull requests belong to competing pull requests; 20 repositories have more than 100 groups of competing pull requests, each of which is submitted by over five developers; 42 repositories have over 10\% of competing pull requests with over 10 same lines of code. Meanwhile, we observe that attributes of competing pull requests do not have strong impacts on pull request integration, comparing with other types of pull requests. Our study provides a preliminary analysis for further research that aims to detect and eliminate conflicts among competing pull requests.},

	abstract = {Software developers submit patches to handle tens or even hundreds of bugs reported daily. However, not all submitted patches can be directly integrated into the code base, since they might not pass patch review that is adopted in most software projects. As the result of patch review, incoming patches can be rejected or asked for resubmission after improvement. Both scenarios interrupt the workflow of patch writers and reviewers, increase their workload, and potentially delay the general development process. In this paper, we aim to help developers write acceptable patches to avoid patch rejection and resubmission. To this end, we derive a comprehensive list of patch rejection reasons from a manual inspection of 300 rejected Eclipse and Mozilla patches, a large-scale online survey of Eclipse and Mozilla developers, and the literature. We also investigate which patch-rejection reasons are more decisive and which are difficult to judge from the perspective of patch reviewers. Our findings include 1) suboptimal solution and incomplete fix are the most frequent patch-rejection reasons 2) whether a patch introduces new bugs is very important yet very difficult to judge 3) reviewers reject a large patch not solely because of its size, but mainly because of the underlying reasons that induce its large size, such as the involvement of unnecessary changes 4) reviewers consider certain problems to be much more destructive than patch writers expect, such as the inconsistency of documentation in a patch and 5) bad timing of patch submission and a lack of communication with team members can also result in a negative patch review.},

Various code hosting sites, notably Github, have tapped on the opportunity to facilitate pull-based development by offering workflow support tools, such as code reviewing systems and integrated issue trackers. In this work, we explore how pull-based software development works, first on the GHTorrent corpus and then on a carefully selected sample of 291 projects. We find that the pull request model offers fast turnaround, increased opportunities for community engagement and decreased time to incorporate contributions. We show that a relatively small number of factors affect both the decision to merge a pull request and the time to process it. We also examine the reasons for pull request rejection and find that technical ones are only a small minority.},

One aspect that has garnered signiﬁcant attention concerning pull request decisions is the identiﬁcation of explanatory factors. Objective: This study builds on a decade of research on pull request decisions and provides further insights. We empirically investigate how factors inﬂuence pull request decisions and the scenarios that change the inﬂuence of such factors. Method: We identify factors inﬂuencing pull request decisions on GitHub through a systematic literature review and infer them by mining archival data. We collect a total of 3,347,937 pull requests with 95 features from 11,230 diverse projects on GitHub. Using these data, we explore the relations among the factors and build mixed effects logistic regression models to empirically explain pull request decisions. Results: Our study shows that a small number of factors explain pull request decisions, with that concerning whether the integrator is the same as or different from the submitter being the most important factor. We also note that the inﬂuence of factors on pull request decisions change with a change in context; e.g., the area hotness of pull request is important only in the early stage of project development, however it becomes unimportant for pull request decisions as projects become mature.},

	abstract = {The pull-based development is widely adopted in modern open-source software (OSS) projects, where developers propose changes to the codebase by submitting a pull request (PR). However, due to many reasons, PRs in OSS projects frequently experience delays across their lifespan, including prolonged waiting times for the first response. Such delays may significantly impact the efficiency and productivity of the development process, as well as the retention of new contributors as long-term contributors.In this paper, we conduct an exploratory study on the time-to-first-response for PRs by analyzing 111,094 closed PRs from ten popular OSS projects on GitHub. We find that bots frequently generate the first response in a PR, and significant differences exist in the timing of bot-generated versus human-generated first responses. We then perform an empirical study to examine the characteristics of bot- and human-generated first responses, including their relationship with the PR’s lifetime. Our results suggest that the presence of bots is an important factor contributing to the time-to-first-response in the pull-based development paradigm, and hence should be separately analyzed from human responses. We also report the characteristics of PRs that are more likely to experience long waiting for the first human-generated response. Our findings have practical implications for newcomers to understand the factors contributing to delays in their PRs.},

Method: We mine software repositories to analyze over 40K PRs from 100 open-source projects in five different programming languages: Python, Java, Kotlin, Haskell, and C/C++. The code quality of the individual PRs was evaluated using static code analysis. Quality flaws were inputted into classification models to predict PRs acceptance and evaluate the fitting. Results: There is a low impact of code quality on PRs acceptance. No major quality flaws can be used to predict reliably PRs acceptance. Conclusion: Source code quality plays a marginal role in accepting PRs in the analyzed projects. Additional factors might impact the acceptance of PRs, such as the reputation and popularity of the submitters.},

	abstract = {Code velocity, or the speed with which code changes are integrated into a production environment, plays a crucial role in Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. Many studies report factors influencing code velocity. However, solutions to increase code velocity are unclear. Meanwhile, the industry continues to issue guidelines on "ideal" code change size, believing it increases code velocity despite lacking evidence validating the practice. Surprisingly, this fundamental question has not been studied to date. This study investigates the practicality of improving code velocity by optimizing pull request size and composition (ratio of insertions, deletions, and modifications). We start with a hypothesis that a moderate correlation exists between pull request size and time-to-merge. We selected 100 most popular, actively developed projects from 10 programming languages on GitHub. We analyzed our dataset of 845,316 pull requests by size, composition, and context to explore its relationship to time-to-merge - a proxy to measure code velocity. Our study shows that pull request size and composition do not relate to time-to-merge. Regardless of the contextual factors that can influence pull request size or composition (e.g., programming language), the observation holds. Pull request data from two other platforms: Gerrit and Phabricator (401,790 code reviews) confirms the lack of relationship. This negative result as in "... eliminate useless hypotheses ..." challenges a widespread belief by showing that small code changes do not merge faster to increase code velocity.},
